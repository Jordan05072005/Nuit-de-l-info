# Nuit-de-l-info

## What is the project ?
This project consists of the creation of a website on a defined theme, in just one night of work (from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m.). This project therefore requires good web management (front and back), fatigue as well as good team cohesion and organization. Because in fact this project was carried out as a team with 3 people.

## What subject it is ?

Man and the Ocean (their similarities)

## What technology is used?

We used Nest and Mongo DB technologies for the backend as well as React for the Frontend.

## Notice :

It was my very first web project. And I loved understanding, trying and exploring these new languages ​​and this new field. I really enjoyed discovering the Web in more detail and learning a lot at the same time.
